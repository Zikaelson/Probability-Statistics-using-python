# Probability-Statistics-using-python

Probability and Statistics form the basis of Data Science. The probability theory is very much helpful for making the prediction. Estimates and predictions form an important part of Data science. With the help of statistical methods, we make estimates for the further analysis.Thus, statistical methods are largely dependent on the theory of probability. And all of probability and statistics is dependent on Data

The objective of this analysis is to be able to apply Statistics & Probability to understand dataset and draw meaningful conclusion using concept of Statistical analysis, Probability and Hypothesis testing through Python
